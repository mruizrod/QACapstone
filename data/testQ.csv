How much has Norway's policy rate changed over the past year?,4,Around 1.2
Is the shift to higher interest rates posing challenges to bond issuers?,7,"As we near the one-year mark since the Fed funds rate peaked, our analysis suggests the core financial health of the median US investmentgrade company remains robust. Interest coverage ratios, despite a downward trend, are still near or just below historical averages. Sustained economic and earnings growth may enable resilient companies to adjust to a higher rate environment. Higher rates may also encourage a more conservative approach to capital management among corporates, which could bolster credit metrics. While the shift to higher interest rates appears generally manageable, it does pose challenges for some. We believe navigating the new landscape of higher rates and structural shifts demand an active, fundamental approach to bond selection."
Can small caps finally outperform?,7,"We think small caps are a coiled spring amid an improving economic backdrop, with lower rates on the horizon across developed markets. US small caps have historically generated strong returns following the dissipation of extreme mega-cap concentration, as well as in US election years.6 In our view, the best way to access the asset class is to be differentiated with high active share to capture outsized opportunities for returns, and be selective, using a disciplined, fundamental approach to avoid unprofitable companies."
What is “normal” for private equity?,7,"Some private equity investors are questioning what a “normal” environment will look like going forward. While the breakneck pace of activity in 2021/22 was likely an anomaly, fueled by historically low rates and easy access to capital, a prolonged return to pre-pandemic trendlines might not be the most likely path forward either. Evergreen structures, combined with the rise of continuation vehicles, are enabling longer hold times for assets. These developments suggest that the size, scope, and nature of deals is likely to continue evolving, defying attempts to define “normal.”"
What is the key takeaway of Goldman's mid-year outlook 2024?,2,1. Macroeconomy: A Longer Path to Normalization; 2. Geopolitics and Elections: Roadmaps for Resilience; 3. Tailwinds and Headwinds: Investing in Megatrends
Are investment theses predicated on the continuation of existing policies?,11,"While prudent investments are never predicated on a single factor, many investors are contemplating how potential policy removals, additions, or alterations can change underwriting assumptions. This can potentially be easier to navigate in the US, where many policies related to supply chains and energy resources have a bottom-up nature that target specific markets, as opposed to in Europe where top-down regulations can fundamentally change the landscape."
What might the US election mean for the Inflation Reduction Act?,11,"The US election creates some uncertainty around sustainable investing. Projects funded by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the signature US climate policy, may see more support if the Democrats win, or receive a different level of support under a Republican administration. Wholesale repeal seems unlikely regardless of who holds office. Despite potential post-US election policy shifts, we continue to expect strong growth in climate-related and low-carbon investment opportunities, driven by improved pricing for solar generation and energy efficiency."
How should investors think about healthcare in an election year?,11,"In the US, healthcare has so far featured less prominently versus prior election cycles. Rising medical costs due to inflation may receive more attention ahead of November’s vote. Private equity acquisitions in healthcare could face increased scrutiny due to concerns of monopolies being created in certain markets, which are then optimized for profits, rather than patient care. As a result, we favor investments that are insulated from reimbursement and “stroke of the pen” risk. More broadly, we remain focused on beneficiaries of long-term growth themes, such as robotics-assisted surgery and anti-obesity drugs, which continue to create investment opportunities."
What are the potential market implications of rising sovereign debt levels?,15,"The level of US sovereign debt is on an upward trajectory, and there is little political momentum for deficit reduction. Higher debt levels in the US and in some other advanced economies may have modest near-term impacts on markets, while long-term effects are difficult to measure. However, we believe shifts in debt burdens should be closely monitored due to potential knock-on effects to fiscal and monetary policy. The flow of bond supply is also worth watching as growing debts and deficits may lead to more sovereign bond issuance, impacting term premia."
How will AI shape real estate and infrastructure?,15,"The rise of generative AI is already impacting real estate and infrastructure. From a real estate perspective, the location of data center assets is critical given affordable and reliable power is a necessity for AI’s evolution. From an infrastructure standpoint, generating and delivering efficient energy will be vital in the coming years to support AI’s expected growth curves. Investors with the resources and expertise to assess both halves of the supply and demand equation look best positioned."
What opportunities are emerging at the intersection of AI and sustainability?,15,"As AI touches an expanding scope of business activities, rising power demand and the prospect of higher data center emissions will drive debate around decarbonization. We expect greater demand for energy efficiency solutions, with AI models potentially playing a key role. AI tools also have the potential to help democratize quality education and foster innovations in healthcare, leading to increased accessibility and affordability. We predict greater use of AI by investors to separate noise from value and accelerate progress across a range of sustainable investing objectives."
What events were attributed to spikes in the Geopolitical Risk Index since 2008?,9,"Crimea War of 2014, US-Iran tensions in 2020, Russia's Invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Middle-East tensions in 2024"
What are current levels of US debt held by the Public as % of GDP and what are Goldman Sach's forecast in the near future?,13,Debt held by the public as % of GDP is approximately90% and Goldman Sachs projects this percentag to be aroun 120% by 2034.
What was the lowest level of US debt held by the Public as % of GDP and in what year was this achieved?,13,"Debt held by the Public as % of GDP in the United States saw a trough in 1974 at around 27%, saw a slight increase till 2000, a decrease at 35% in 2006, and has increased ever since."
What happened in the first six months of 2024 globally in terms of politics?,8,"The first half of 2024 was particularly eventful for emerging markets (EMs). In Taiwan, the Democratic Progressive Party secured its third consecutive victory, suggesting that significant policy shifts are unlikely, although tensions with China are expected to remain high. Elections in India, Mexico, and South Africa contributed to market volatility. India, which hosted the world's largest election, saw Prime Minister Modi win a third term. However, his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), did not secure a majority and had to rely on coalition partners to form the government."
